### Module Map

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `physics_engine.py` | Solves the 2-D Advection-Diffusion Equation via an explicit FTCS scheme. Generates a Latin-Hypercube-sampled training set of 200 (T, u, D) → concentration-field pairs. |
| `surrogate_model.py` | Trains a Random Forest **and** an MLP on the physics data. Exposes `predict()` for instant field estimation and `compare_conditions()` for structured metric extraction. |
| `reporting_layer.py` | LangChain `LLMChain` with a structured prompt template. Ships with a deterministic `PlaceholderLLM` (no API key needed). Swap one line to plug in GPT-4 or Claude. |
| `app.py` | Streamlit dashboard. Dark industrial theme. Live sliders → heatmap → metrics → full comparative report. |

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Creating a virtual Environment
python -m venv venv

# 2.  Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3.  Run the dashboard  (from the project root)
streamlit run app.py
```

On first load Streamlit will:
1. Generate 300 physics samples (~15-30 s depending on your CPU).
2. Train both surrogate models.
3. Render the dashboard with instant predictions.

Subsequent interactions (slider moves) are **sub-second** — that is the whole
point of the surrogate.

## How to Swap in a Real LLM

In `reporting_layer.py`, replace the chain construction:

```python
# Before  (offline placeholder)
llm = PlaceholderLLM()

# After  (OpenAI)
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=0.2)
```

Everything else — the prompt template, the variable injection, the report
structure — stays identical.

## How This Project Demonstrates "Independent Issue Identification" for CFD Workflows

Traditional CFD pipelines are **reactive**: an engineer sets up a simulation,
waits for it to finish, then manually inspects the results.  Issues — unstable
meshes, physically implausible concentration spikes, parameter regions where the
solver diverges — are only discovered *after* the expensive compute is done.

This project flips that paradigm by building **three layers of autonomous
issue identification** directly into the workflow:

### 1. Physics-Level Self-Checking (physics_engine.py)
The solver **automatically enforces the CFL stability criterion** before
every run.  It computes the tightest constraint across diffusive and advective
limits and adjusts `dt` accordingly.  A human engineer would have to calculate
this by hand or risk a blow-up; the engine does it silently and correctly every
time.  This is the first form of independent issue identification: the system
flags (and fixes) stability problems before they exist.

### 2. AI-Level Anomaly Detection (surrogate_model.py)
By training **two architecturally different models** (Random Forest and MLP)
on the same data and comparing their outputs pointwise, the surrogate layer
produces a **per-prediction uncertainty map**.  Where the two models disagree,
the system flags those spatial regions as requiring full-resolution CFD
validation.  The engineer never has to guess which parts of the domain are
reliable — the AI tells them.  This is independent issue identification at
the prediction level.

### 3. Report-Level Trend Detection (reporting_layer.py)
The LangChain reporting module does not simply echo numbers.  It **interprets
the comparative metrics** — concentration ratios, plume-spread changes,
uncertainty magnitudes — and generates qualitative engineering conclusions:
*"Condition B produced significantly higher peak concentrations …"* or
*"Non-trivial disagreement between surrogates is observed; validate with CFD."*
A junior analyst reading the report immediately knows what needs attention
without having to dig through raw data.  This is independent issue
identification at the communication level.

**Together, these three layers mean the system can surface problems — numerical,
physical, and operational — without waiting for a human to go looking for
them.  That is the core value proposition for accelerating ammonia
simulation workflows.**


## 🧠 Mathematical Foundation

The simulation is built upon the **2D Advection-Diffusion Equation**, which governs the transport of Ammonia ($NH_3$) in a fluid medium. 

### 1. The Governing PDE
The spatio-temporal evolution of the concentration $C(x, y, t)$ is defined as:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + \underbrace{\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla C}_{\text{Advection}} = \underbrace{D_{eff} \nabla^2 C}_{\text{Diffusion}} + \underbrace{S}_{\text{Source}}$$

Where:
* $\mathbf{u} = (u_x, u_y)$: The velocity vector of the fluid flow (m/s).
* $D_{eff}$: The effective diffusion coefficient ($m^2/s$).
* $S$: The source term representing the ammonia release rate.



### 2. Temperature Dependency (Thermodynamics)
The model incorporates the temperature effect on molecular diffusivity. Based on the Chapman-Enskog theory, the diffusion coefficient is scaled as:

$$D_{eff} = D_{ref} \left( \frac{T}{T_{ref}} \right)^{1.75}$$

This ensures that as temperature ($T$) increases, the kinetic energy of the ammonia molecules leads to a faster spatial spread, which the Neural Surrogate is trained to capture.

### 3. Numerical Scheme
The "Ground Truth" data is generated using a **Forward-Time Central-Space (FTCS)** finite difference method. 
- **Stability:** The timestep $\Delta t$ is dynamically constrained by the **CFL (Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy)** condition:
  $$\Delta t \le \frac{\Delta x^2}{4D_{eff}}$$
- **Positivity Preservation:** A ReLU-like clamp $C = \max(0, C)$ is applied to prevent numerical oscillations and  maintainphysical reality.
